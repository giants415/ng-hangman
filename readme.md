### Reflection

This training was a good introduction to Angular. By the end of this training I felt that I had a decent understanding of how Angular's directives, modules, and controllers interact with each other. With this training as a foundation, I was able to solidify my understanding of these core concepts further after completing level 1 of Code School's Angular Intro.
